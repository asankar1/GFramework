# GFramework

The idea of GFramework is to develop a 'Generic framework' to create any application that supports and test the following:

  * Variant
  * Reflection
  * Serialization with versioning
  * Lua script
  * Doxygen generation

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Platforms supported

This currently supports WIndows OS and built using Visual C++ 2015. However, it will not be difficult to port it to other build tools and platforms, if the prerequisites are met.

### Prerequisites

To build this project you need
  * C++14 compatible compiler
  * Boost header only library files 1.63.0
  * glm math library 0.9.8
  * Lua 5.3.4
  * Doxygen generator
